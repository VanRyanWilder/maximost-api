📈 Body Hardware HUD (The Biometric Airlock)
Objective: Centralizing Human Performance Data

1. The Biometric Grid
The Body HUD must be a right-side Slide-In Overlay that aggregates the following from the Terra API and Samsung/Loop imports:

Metrics: Height, Weight, BMI, Body Fat %, Resting Heart Rate, and HRV.

The 1% Anchor: When the HUD is open, the Starting 5 pips must remain visible at the top to maintain the "Console" feel.

2. Sovereignty Toggles
Sync/Ignore: Every biometric field must have a toggle to "Ignore" data from specific sources.

Manual Override: If the Operator manually logs a weight, the system must Lock that entry, preventing the Terra API or CSV imports from overwriting it.
