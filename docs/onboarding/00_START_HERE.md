# 🚀 The Onboarding Brief: MAXIMOST
**Welcome to the Iron Skeleton.**

### 1. THE CORE DIRECTIVE: ZERO GUESSING
If a technical requirement is not in the `/docs`, do not invent a solution. Consult the AI Partner or the Operator.

### 2. THE ARCHITECTURE
* **The Iron Skeleton (Backend)**: Hardened Hono/Supabase rig with v12 JSONB metadata. Do not use legacy columns.
* **The Lens (Frontend)**: A unified console. Every internal page must be wrapped in `CoreLayout`.
* **The Airlock (Data)**: Manual user entries always override API data. We prioritize Sovereignty.

### 3. THE HANDSHAKE
Every deployment requires an update to the `99_AAR_LOG.md`. If it isn't logged, it didn't happen.
