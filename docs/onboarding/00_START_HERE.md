🚀 The Onboarding Brief
Welcome to the MAXIMOST Command Center.

This is a proprietary Behavioral Compiler. You are here to maintain the Iron Skeleton (Backend) and refine the Lens (Frontend).

1. The Golden Rule: Zero Guessing
If a technical requirement is not in the /docs, do not invent a solution. Consult the AI Partner or the Operator immediately.

2. Your First Order of Operations
Before you touch any code in src/, you must perform this sequence:

Read the Manifesto: Understand why we build for Sovereignty.

Review the AAR Log: See the "Red Phone" status and current bottlenecks.

Check the Standard: Review the Master Toolbelt for v12 JSONB metadata keys.

3. The Documentation Mandate
Every PR and every bug fix must be logged by you in the docs/core/99_AAR_LOG.md.

Log Format: [DATE] [DEV_NAME] [FIX/CHANGE] [NEXT STEPS].

Reasoning: This log is the "Black Box" of the Rig. If the system fails, we look here first.
